### Summary
Word Guess Game is a simplified version of the classic Hangman game. I made this project as a part of Dev10's Web Development course as a prework assignment. 

### Requirements 
* Choose a theme for your game! In the demo, we picked an 80s theme: 80s questions, 80s sound and an 80s aesthetic. You can choose any subject for your theme, though, so be creative!
* Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.
* Display the following on the page:
  * Press any key to get started!
  * Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).
  * If the word is `madonna`, display it like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`.
  * As the user guesses the correct letters, reveal them: `m a d o _  _ a`.
  * Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).
  * Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like `L Z Y H`).
* After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.

### Installation
To run this application, download the GitHub zip file or clone the repository. Then open a browsser window and within it open the index.html file in the directory of your application. 

### How To Play
Begin the game by pressing any key A random word (city) is picked from the predetermined list and is displayed with underscores for each letter and the user is prompted to type in a letter guess. If a correct letter is guessed, the game will reveal the letter in its correct location. If an incorrect letter is selected, then it will add the letter to a list on incorrectly guessed letters and decrement the remaining guesses count.
